        <p style="font-size:x-large; border:2px solid turquoise;"> I'll talk about Cats: </p>

        <p style = "font-size: x-large; font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"> Cats are professionals at doing absolutely nothing and still looking adorable. 
        One minute they're sleeping like angels, and the next they're running around the house at 3 a.m. 
        like they pay rent. No matter what they do, they always manage to make us laugh. </p>

        <h1 style="font-size:x-large; border: 2px solid turquoise;"> I will not be talking too much about dogs: </h1>

        <p style="font-family:'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;font-size: x-large;"> But dogs are pure sunshine with four legs. They love running around, wagging their tails, 
            and following the people they care about. </p>

the old pond. 
A frog jumped in. 
Plop.
